# Java-Applications

Overview
This report discusses the result of the work done in development of “JAVA Application World”
 on Java Platform. It is a part of the project going in Computer Science Department, Mahaveer Swami Institute of Technology
at the development of an application framework for providing a common platform for facilitating the use
of JAVA Applications and integration of various tools developed
during the execution of the project.


Project Objective

The Java Application World software is a platform where the user can use different applications which are developed in Java language such as calculator, notepad, ip finder, puzzle games, word count tool, source code generator, tic tac toe game, exam system among many others. This all in one application serves a lot of needs of the user and in exchange gives the user a fun packed and very useful Java application program.

The Java Application World application world software is totally user oriented and only users access the software programs. The user can use multiple applications that re made with the help of java. In the JApps or the Java application world, the user can use calculator, word count tool, ip finder etc java run software. Any particular IDE can be used for the development of the project. You can choose Eclipse, netbeans according to your convenience. The front end tool required for this project is the JAVA swing but no such back end tools are being used. The user interface has been given a nice and trendy look with a professional feeling.





Existing System

In the existing Java Application World system, all the java applications need to be used in various different ID’s as per there compatible mode. In the existing Java Application World system, there is no particular format for programming and running of all the java applications at one format. Existing Java Application World system needs to be redeveloped in order to make it all the java programs friendly.

Proposed System

Proposed Java Application World system is totally as per the norms and provides a platform where all the java applications can be developed and deployed successfully. This is basically an all in one technology and is a very useful program for all the java applications. The application is totally an user friendly application.

User Modules

The Japp world is totally users oriented and the users has the exclusivity to avail the offers or services provided by the application. The user can use multiple applications that re made with the help of java. In the JApps or the Java application world, the user can use calculator, word count tool, ip finder etc java run software for recreational enjoyment or important needs

Tools to be used

Any particular IDE can be used for the development of the project. You can choose Eclipse, myEclipse or netbeans according to your convenience. The front end tool required for this project is the JAVA swing but no such back end tools are being used.
The user interface has been given a nice and trendy look with a professional feeling.
